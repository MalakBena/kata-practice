# Kata Practice

Welcome to the Kata Practice repository! Here you will find a collection of code katas which help me practice my skills in Javascript, Python, and SQL. I wll be using Test Driven Development (TDD) because it helps us to write better, more robust and maintainable code.

## What are code katas?
Code katas are small coding exercises that help you improve your programming skills through repetition and deliberate practice. They are typically short and focused on a particular skill or concept, and can be completed in just a few minutes.
